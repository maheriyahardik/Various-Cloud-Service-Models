Cloud service models are categorized into three main types, each serving different purposes and levels of control. These models define how cloud services are delivered and managed.

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.

Users get control over operating systems, storage, and networking.

Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines

Use Case: Hosting websites, running applications, disaster recovery, and storage.

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Offers a development platform with tools and frameworks for application development.

Users focus on application development without managing infrastructure.

Examples: Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure App Services

Use Case: Developing and deploying applications, database management, and collaboration.

3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
Provides ready-to-use software applications over the internet.

No need for installation or maintenance; managed entirely by providers.

Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox, Salesforce

Use Case: Email, CRM, file storage, and collaboration tools.
